# Confidential Identity Verification â€” Privacy-Preserving KYC with FHEVM

Confidential Identity Verification is a privacy-preserving KYC module built with Zamaâ€™s **Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine (FHEVM)**.  
It allows users to prove compliance (e.g., age, nationality, KYC approval) **without revealing sensitive data** on-chain.

## âœ¨ Features
- ðŸ”’ **Encrypted KYC Flags** â€” user data such as `isOver18` or `isKYCApproved` stored as encrypted booleans (`ebool`).  
- âœ… **Fail-Closed Verification** â€” if a proof is invalid, status defaults to *unverified*.  
- ðŸ”— **Composable** â€” other dApps (DEX, NFT marketplaces, DAOs, lending pools) can integrate for compliance.  
- âš¡ **EVM Compatible** â€” works with Solidity + Hardhat.  
- ðŸ§ª **Test Coverage** â€” TypeScript tests for encrypted proof submission & verification checks.
